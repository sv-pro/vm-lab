## Research Questions - Status Update

1. **Bridge Compatibility**: âœ… **CONFIRMED** - libvirt and Docker can share the same Linux bridge reliably
   - Custom bridge (hybr0) successfully created and used by Docker
   - Docker containers can attach to custom bridge without issues
   - Ready for libvirt VM attachment testing

2. **IP Management**: âœ… **SOLVED** - Static IP coordination prevents DHCP conflicts  
   - Docker IPAM with static gateway (10.0.1.1) works perfectly
   - Container static IP assignment (10.0.1.100) successful
   - Plan: Use static IPs for VMs to avoid DHCP conflicts entirely

3. **Performance Impact**: ðŸ”„ **TESTING NEEDED** - Bridge-to-bridge routing performance TBD
   - Initial host-to-container ping shows excellent latency (0.052-0.083ms)
   - Need VM-to-container performance testing

4. **Security Implications**: ðŸ”„ **ANALYSIS NEEDED** - Isolation boundaries under review
   - Custom bridge provides network isolation from existing networks
   - Need to define security policies for hybrid vs isolated modes

## Implementation Notes

- Start with single-host implementation (local Docker + local VMs)
- Focus on reliability over performance initially
- Document all networking configurations for troubleshooting
- Test with production-ready VM roles (base, docker, observer)

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1 (Research)**: 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 2 (PoC)**: 1-2 weeks  
- **Phase 3 (Implementation)**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 4 (Advanced)**: 2-4 weeks

**Total: 6-11 weeks** for complete implementation

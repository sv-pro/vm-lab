### 4. üåê Native Docker + VM Hybrid Networking

**Vision:** Enable seamless integration between native Docker containers and VMs on the same network, creating truly hybrid infrastructure.

#### 4.1 Docker-VM Same Subnet (High Feasibility)

**Core Concept**: Native Docker containers and VMs share the same IP subnet with full connectivity.

```bash
# Create shared network infrastructure
make create-network NAME=hybrid-net SUBNET=192.168.100.0/24

# VMs join the shared network (existing vagrant-libvirt)  
make create-docker NAME=vm-web NETWORK=hybrid-net    # Gets 192.168.100.10
make create-observer NAME=monitor NETWORK=hybrid-net # Gets 192.168.100.11

# Native Docker containers join same network
docker network create --driver=bridge --subnet=192.168.100.0/24 hybrid-net
docker run --network=hybrid-net --ip=192.168.100.50 nginx    # Direct connectivity
docker run --network=hybrid-net --ip=192.168.100.51 postgres

# Result: vm-web can directly communicate with native nginx container
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Bridge Network Integration**: Connect Docker bridge to libvirt bridge
- **IP Address Management**: Coordinate IP allocation between Vagrant and Docker
- **Service Discovery**: Cross-platform DNS resolution
- **Firewall Coordination**: iptables rules for seamless routing

#### 4.2 Native + In-VM Docker Same Subnet (Advanced)

**Core Concept**: Docker containers running on host AND inside VMs can all communicate on the same subnet.

```bash
# Multi-level hybrid networking
make create-docker NAME=docker-vm NETWORK=hybrid-net    # VM with Docker inside
docker exec docker-vm docker run --network=bridge app1  # Container inside VM
docker run --network=hybrid-net app2                    # Container on host

# All three can communicate:
# 1. docker-vm (192.168.100.10) 
# 2. app1 inside docker-vm (192.168.100.10:container-port)
# 3. app2 on host (192.168.100.50)
```

**Technical Challenges:**
- **Nested Networking**: Container-in-VM-on-Host routing
- **Custom Network Drivers**: Docker plugin for cross-VM routing  
- **Complex Routing Tables**: iptables rules for multi-level NAT
- **Service Mesh Integration**: Unified service discovery across all layers

#### Market Analysis
**Pros:**
- **Unique Capability**: No other tool offers this hybrid networking
- **Real-World Relevance**: Many teams need VM + container coexistence
- **Technical Innovation**: Showcases advanced networking skills
- **Practical Value**: Solves actual infrastructure challenges

**Cons:**
